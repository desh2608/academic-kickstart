# About

I am a second-year PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/), working in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/), advised by [Dan Povey](http://www.danielpovey.com) and [Sanjeev Khudanpur](https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/). My research interests are in applied machine learning, particularly deep learning methods for speech recognition and language modeling. I am currently working on speaker adaptation methods for ASR systems. 

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My [bachelor thesis]({{<ref "project/btp.md">}}) was on deep learning methods for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by [Prof. Ashish Anand](http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html). 

When I'm not doing ML, I like to work out, play guitar, and [read fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62772844-desh-raj?shelf=read&sort=date_read).
