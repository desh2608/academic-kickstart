# About

I am a graduate student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/), working in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). My research interests are in theoretical and applied machine learning, particularly unsupervised learning techniques for language.

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My [bachelor thesis]({{<ref "project/btp.md">}}) was on deep learning methods for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by [Prof. Ashish Anand](http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html). 

When I'm not doing ML, I like to work out, swim, play the guitar, and [read fiction](https://medium.com/deshs-book-reviews).
