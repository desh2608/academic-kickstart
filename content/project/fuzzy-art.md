* Worked on improving clustering performance of fuzzy ART algorithm by integrating Interval Type-2 approach into vigilance parameter computation.
* Obtained 5-10% better classification results compared to earlier ART methods, on several benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, and real world image segmentation tasks.
