In this project, we reviewed existing work on probabilistic databases, categorized into 5 major sections, namely algebra, query evaluation, conditioning, scaling and implementation. Through a reevaluation of performance parameters, we showed that query evaluation is indeed the bottleneck in efficient development and implementation of the probabilistic DBMS model.
